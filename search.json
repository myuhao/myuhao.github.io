Sweedler; Profiling of d-alanine production\nby the microbial isolates of rat gut microbiota; The FASEB\nJournal, 2022 [PubMed]\n\n\n\n\n\nWe isolated D-amino acid producing bacteria strains from rat gut\nmicrobiome and characterized the D-amino acid level using biochemical\nand MS-based approaches. Our analysis furthered the idea that microbial\nmetabolites modulate host physiology.\n\n\nTulsi A. Patel, Troy P. Carnwath, Xue Wang, Mariet Allen, Sarah J.\nLincoln, Laura J.
